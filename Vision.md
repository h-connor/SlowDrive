#  SlowDrive - Our Vision

SlowDrive is an application system that will be used to notify drivers if they are speeding. Similar to a radar speed gun, this application measures the speed of the driver, and in addition, indicates as to whether or not the driver is over the speed limit.

# Our Values

SlowDrive main goal is to improve road safety and securing driver's finances. Mainly by reducing the risk of road accidents cause by over or under speeding and preventing drivers from getting speeding ticket.

# Audience

Anyone driving a vehicle will be capable of using this system. This includes but is not limited to, students learning to drive, people driving to or from work, cab drivers, bus drivers, people driving from a bar; whether this is in a motorized or automotive vehicle. 

# Our Plan

The system is primarily designed to track the speed of the driver while having knowledge of the speed limit in the area of the driver’s current location. It will allow the speed of the driver to be viewed with a distinguishable form of telling the driver if they need to slow down.

The system will be used to reduce potential dangers or tickets that rise from speeding. It will tell the driver with sounds or vibrations indicating that the driver should slow down. Since the system only considers the speed of the driver, it does not need to recognize what type of vehicle the driver is in. It will need to maintain a method of retrieving speed limits in specific areas of the driver’s location.

This system will be an improvement over current systems in use, which supports limited features to indicate changes in speed limits over unknown areas while being within different interfaces; most notable being the speedometer in front of the steering wheel of a car, with some newer car models supporting speed limit display on a screen viewable to the driver. As a result of our system, further functionality can be provided such as the user being directly informed of exceeding the speed limit. In addition, our system offers further flexibility by being independent of the vehicle in use. That is, a driver can use this system in any vehicle.

 


# Medium

This system is visualized to be a mobile application on any android device. Future releases may include compatibility to come with a vehicle itself where the application is embedded in the vehicle’s system, or with any form of a mobile device that is commonly near a driver such as an iPhone .


# Measuring Success

An indication of success for the application is the decrease of road accidents by 5% for the first year after initially publishing the application. This will be done by the ease of use for the application and elimination of distractions. In order to reduce the risk of distracted driving and encourage the ease of use, our system does not require hands-on use whilst in the process of driving. That is, our system does not require any use from the user in order to function other than opening our system.This will help meet the goal of reducing the risk of accidents as well as prevent drivers from getting a speeding ticket and thus, improving driver’s safety and securing finances.
